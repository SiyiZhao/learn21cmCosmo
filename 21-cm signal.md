这是示意图，实际上各个阶段的准确数值 取决于model，
这也是 global  signal detections 的目标。

## EoR detect 

## Cosmic Dawn detect

“Compared to the 21 cm tomography experiments, measurement of **the global 21 cm emission** has a _higher raw sensitivity_ and requires _smaller collecting area_, so that it could be conducted even with a single antenna.” (Shi et al., 2022, p. 1)
