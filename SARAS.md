### The origin of the profile found by Bowman et al.

“there might be an uncalibrated systematic in the form of a sinusoidal undulation with period 12.5 MHz” (Singh et al., 2021, p. 5)

“Inhomogeneous ground beneath the antenna of the EDGES Low-band instrument has been suggested14 as an origin for systematic errors” (Singh et al., 2021, p. 5)

“The distributions in ζ in the two cases have standard deviations of 0.43 and give the probability of a false negative to be 2%.” (Singh et al., 2021, p. 4)
